Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) was introduced and developed through the contributions of several key figures in the computer science field during the 1960s and 1970s. 
Hereâ€™s a brief overview of how OOP evolved and the people who played a significant role in its development:

Early Concepts and Foundations Simula (1960s): The concept of OOP was first introduced in the 1960s with the development of the Simula programming language. 
Ole-Johan Dahl and Kristen Nygaard were the primary developers of Simula at the Norwegian Computing Center (Norsk Regnesentral) in Oslo, Norway. 
Simula is considered one of the first object-oriented languages because it introduced the concept of classes and objects, and allowed the creation of reusable software components through these abstractions.
Evolution and Popularization Smalltalk (1970s): Following Simula, the next significant development in OOP was the creation of the Smalltalk programming language. 
Alan Kay, Dan Ingalls, Adele Goldberg, and other researchers at Xerox PARC (Palo Alto Research Center) developed Smalltalk in the early 1970s. 
Smalltalk was influential in popularizing the OOP paradigm. 
It introduced many concepts of modern OOP, including the notion of objects as the fundamental units of computation, and it emphasized the importance of message passing between objects.
Further Developments C++ (1980s): The OOP concepts from Simula and Smalltalk were further refined and incorporated into the C++ programming language.
Bjarne Stroustrup began developing C++ at Bell Labs in the early 1980s. 
C++ was designed to be an extension of the C programming language with object-oriented features added, allowing for both procedural and object-oriented programming. 
Java (1990s): Java further solidified the adoption of OOP principles and became widely used.
