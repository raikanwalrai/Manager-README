Write a Python class MinDifferenceFinder that, given a list L of integers and a positive integer P, finds the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum values in any subset of size P from the list L. The list L contains more elements than P, and the elements of the subset must be distinct. If multiple subsets have the same minimum difference, the class will return that minimum value.

Description:
The task is to pick P different elements from the list L where the difference between the maximum and minimum value is minimized compared to other subsets. The class-based implementation should:

Sort the list L: Sorting the list will allow for easier calculation of the difference between consecutive elements.
Find the Minimum Difference: Iterate through subsets of size P and calculate the difference between the maximum and minimum of each subset.
Return the Minimum Difference: After comparing all possible subsets, return the minimum difference found.

class MinDifferenceFinder:
    def __init__(self, L, P):
        """
        Initializes the object with a list of integers L and a positive integer P.
        """
        self.L = L
        self.P = P

    def find_min_difference(self):
        """
        Finds the minimum difference between the maximum and minimum values in any subset of size P.
        """
        # Sort the list to make it easier to find the minimum difference
        self.L.sort()
        
        # Initialize variables
        min_diff = float('inf')  # Start with a large number for minimum difference
        M = len(self.L)
        
        # Iterate through the list and check subsets of size P
        for i in range(M - self.P + 1):
            current_diff = self.L[i + self.P - 1] - self.L[i]
            if current_diff < min_diff:
                min_diff = current_diff

        return min_diff


# Example usage:
if __name__ == "__main__":
    L = [3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12, 13]
    P = 5
    finder = MinDifferenceFinder(L, P)
    print(f"Minimum Difference: {finder.find_min_difference()}")


Explanation:
Class MinDifferenceFinder:

This class takes the list L and the integer P as inputs via the __init__ method.
The find_min_difference method calculates the minimum difference by iterating through the list, finding subsets of size P, and calculating the difference between the maximum and minimum values in each subset.
The method returns the smallest difference found.
Sorting:

The list L is sorted before calculation, as it simplifies finding the smallest difference in a subset of consecutive elements.
Iterative Calculation:

The program iterates through the sorted list and checks each subset of size P by calculating the difference between the last and first element in the subset (since the list is sorted, this will always give the minimum difference in that subset).
Efficiency:

Sorting the list takes 
O(nlogn), and the subsequent loop runs in 
O(n), making the overall time complexity 
O(nlogn), which is efficient for this problem.
Example Input/Output:
Input:
L = [3, 4, 1, 9, 56, 7, 9, 12, 13]
P = 5
Output:
Minimum Difference: 6

Explanation:
The two subsets with the minimum difference are [3, 4, 7, 9, 9] and [7, 9, 9, 12, 13]. 
In both cases, the difference between the maximum and minimum values is 6, which is the smallest possible difference for any subset of size P.

Improved Problem Complexity:
This version generalizes the problem by creating a class that can handle multiple instances of the problem and ensures a clean, modular approach to solving it. 
The class-based implementation provides better readability and reusability, especially when working with multiple lists and P values.
