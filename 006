Write a Python class that solves a variant of the Goldbach's Conjecture for a given even integer n, but with an added constraint: 
each pair of prime numbers (p1, p2) must satisfy the condition that the difference between p1 and p2 is less than or equal to a given threshold d.

For example, given an even integer n and a threshold d, the task is to:

Find all pairs of prime numbers (p1, p2) such that p1 + p2 = n and |p1 - p2| â‰¤ d.
Return these pairs as a list of tuples, sorted in ascending order.
Example:
Input:

n = 40
d = 10
Output:

[(17, 23), (19, 21)]
Explanation:

For n = 40, valid prime pairs that sum up to 40 and whose difference is less than or equal to 10 are (17, 23) and (19, 21).

Explanation:
Class ConstrainedGoldbach:

This class is initialized with an even integer n and a difference constraint d. If the input for n is not an even number greater than 2, or if the difference constraint d is negative, an appropriate error is raised.
Method is_prime:

Checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to half the number.
Method find_constrained_goldbach_pairs:

Iterates over possible pairs (p1, p2) such that p1 + p2 = n, and checks if both numbers are prime and their absolute difference is less than or equal to d. The valid pairs are added to a result list and sorted in ascending order.
Example Input/Output:
Example 1:
Input:
n = 40
d = 10
Output:
[(17, 23), (19, 21)]
Example 2:
Input:
n = 50
d = 5
Output:
[(19, 31), (23, 27)]
Key Differences and Complexity:
Added Constraint: The main complexity comes from the additional constraint of ensuring the difference between the two primes in the pair does not exceed d. 
This makes it slightly more complex than the basic Goldbach problem.

Input Validation: The class checks if both inputs, n and d, are valid. 
If n is not an even number greater than 2 or d is negative, appropriate errors are raised.

Prime Pair Search: The search for prime pairs now not only looks for primes that sum to n, but also ensures their difference is within the specified limit.
