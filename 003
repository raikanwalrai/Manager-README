Write a Python class Quadrilateral that accepts the lengths of four sides and the diagonals of a quadrilateral. The class should:
Check if the quadrilateral is valid: 
A quadrilateral is valid if the sum of the lengths of any three sides is greater than the length of the fourth side (generalized quadrilateral inequality theorem).
Classify the quadrilateral by its sides: 
A valid quadrilateral can be classified as Square, Rectangle, Rhombus, Parallelogram, or a Generic Quadrilateral based on the lengths of its sides and diagonals.
Classify the quadrilateral by its angles:  
If the diagonals of a quadrilateral are perpendicular, it forms an orthodiagonal quadrilateral. Classify the quadrilateral based on this property.
Calculate the area of the quadrilateral: 
Use Brahmagupta's formula (for cyclic quadrilaterals) or an approximation using the diagonals and side lengths.
Description:
The Quadrilateral class performs multiple classifications and calculations based on the sides and diagonals provided by the user. 
The class includes the following functionalities:

is_valid(): Checks whether the quadrilateral is valid using a generalized form of the triangle inequality theorem.
classify_by_sides(): Classifies the quadrilateral as Square, Rectangle, Rhombus, Parallelogram, or Generic based on the side lengths and diagonals.
classify_by_diagonals(): Classifies the quadrilateral as Orthodiagonal (diagonals are perpendicular) or Non-Orthodiagonal.
area(): Calculates the area of the quadrilateral using Brahmagupta’s formula if it's cyclic, or an approximation based on diagonals otherwise.

Problem Constraints:
Sides and diagonals should be positive numbers.
The quadrilateral's validity should follow generalized geometric rules.

Input Validation: Ensures that sides and diagonals are positive numbers. If any side is non-positive or violates the quadrilateral inequality, the quadrilateral is invalid.
is_valid(): Generalized inequality checks for quadrilaterals.
classify_by_sides(): Determines the type of quadrilateral based on side lengths and diagonals (e.g., Square, Rectangle, Rhombus).
classify_by_diagonals(): Uses a Pythagorean check to classify the quadrilateral as Orthodiagonal or Non-Orthodiagonal.
Area Calculation: First attempts Brahmagupta’s formula for cyclic quadrilaterals. If invalid, falls back to an approximate formula based on the diagonals.

Example Input and Output:

Enter side a: 4
Enter side b: 4
Enter side c: 4
Enter side d: 4
Enter diagonal 1: 5.656
Enter diagonal 2: 5.656
Quadrilateral is valid.
Side Classification: Square
Diagonal Classification: Orthodiagonal
Area of Quadrilateral: 16.0

This problem introduces a quadrilateral, which is slightly more complex than triangles due to additional conditions and calculations required for sides and diagonals. 
The code follows OOP principles and builds upon the logic of the triangle problem but with more layers of complexity and properties to classify.
